Tweet allows Twitter @username and #hashtag text in wordpress posts to automatically link to Twitter.

== Description ==

I wanted a quick and simple way to just automatically link to a Twitter userpage or Twitter search whenever I wrote them in a blog post.
The other plugins where full featured or only linked to the username in the sidebar or widget.
Whenever you put an `@username` in a post, it will link to the matching twitter user page.
Whenever you put a `#hashtag` in a post, it will link to the matching twitter search page.
	
== Installation ==

1. Create directory `tweet` in your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Upload `tweet.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/tweet/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Optional - You can customise your username link by using the <em>tweet-username</em> CSS class.
5. Optional - You can customise your hashtag link by using the <em>tweet-hashtag</em> CSS class.</p>
